# *Oddam w dobre rÄ™ce*
**A Python-Django web app for charity donations management.**

## About
This project was one of the last big assignements on the Python Developer bootcamp.

It's been made based on given set of the fictional client's requirements that must have been met. Layout in HTML and CSS together with mockups were already delivered, so while they are not part of my work, I had to make sure in the end everything was well connected and working as  intended. 

Basically my job was to write all the Django back-end from scratch and add some JS, HTML, CSS code on  the front-end side to get things working.
